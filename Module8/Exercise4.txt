Using the logical database diagram from Exercise 1, show how Redis could be incorporated into your blogging system to improve performance.

1. Add an extra box representing Redis to your existing diagram.
   - Redis can be used as a cache for frequently accessed data such as user sessions, popular posts, and comments.

2. Use arrows to indicate the data flow between Redis and the database.
   - When a user logs in, their session data is stored in Redis.
   - When a post is accessed frequently, its data is cached in Redis to reduce database load.
   - Comments for popular posts can also be cached in Redis for quick retrieval.

Diagram:
 [Client] --> [Web Server] --> [Redis Cache] <--> [Database]

- The web server first checks Redis for cached data.
- If data is not found in Redis, it retrieves it from the database and then stores it in Redis for future requests.
